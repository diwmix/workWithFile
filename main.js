I don't really remember too much about the old country... except that we were pretty hard up. And then one day, my father decided it was time to move away. Away from Sicily. Across the ocean to start a new life in America. Never in my life had I seen anything as fantastic as Empire Bay. It was beautiful. On the other hand, I'd never seen anything filthier or more disgusting than our new shithole of an apartment. "The American Dream." It was more like a nightmare. My father started working at the part for the guy who arranged our emigration. It was back-breaking work, and what little money he made mostly went towards booze. Eventually parents sent me to school. I had to learn English, and I sure as hell wasn't gonna do that in a neighbourhood full of italians. That's where I met Joeâ€¦`)
